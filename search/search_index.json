If you never did that, read this introduction to the command line . Windows Subsystem for Linux \u00b6 Follow this guide to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Todo select the latest Ubuntu? or Ubuntu 20.04? In broad terms, the WSL lets you start a virtual machine with a different operating system running on it, without requiring a dual boot. VSCode \u00b6 Follow this guide to install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on Windows. Note VSCode is installed on the Windows operating system. The Remote Development Extension Pack is what lets you access the tools installed on the WSL (e.g. Python, gcc). Todo install a bunch of useful extensions, give a list Python \u00b6 Managing Python version \u00b6 On Ubuntu 20.04, the default version of python installed is 3.8. If you need to install a different version of python, there are several ways. Two are reported here. deadsnakes PPA \u00b6 One of the methods to install a new program on Ubuntu (and many other Linux distributions) is with the command apt install <package_name> . There are many programs available in the standard repositories checked by apt , but to install a different version of python you need to add another Personal Package Archive (PPA). The needed one is the deadsnakes PPA. Add it with sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa sudo apt update Once added, several python-related packages will be available. sudo apt install pythonX.Y # install pythonX.Y sudo apt install pythonX.Y-dev # includes development headers for building C extensions sudo apt install pythonX.Y-venv # provides the standard library `venv` module Where X and Y are the required major and minor version. pyenv \u00b6 Once set up, pyenv lets you install a specific version of python by running pyenv install <version> that you can then use with pyenv shell <version> # select just for current shell session pyenv local <version> # automatically select whenever you are # in the current directory (or its subdirectories) pyenv global <version> # select globally for your user account It is very easy to use but the installation process is more involved, but it is clearly explained in this blog post . Managing project dependencies \u00b6 Different projects might require different version of the same python package. Installing a package system wide is generally a bad idea. Venv \u00b6 The venv module (of the Python standard library) provides support for creating lightweight \u201cvirtual environments\u201d with their own site directories, optionally isolated from system site directories. Each virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was used to create this environment) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages in its site directories 1 . You can create a virtual environment with python3 -m venv <venv_name> and use it with source <venv_name>/bin/activate Now, when you run python and pip commands, the ones inside the virtual environment will be used. Poetry \u00b6 Poetry offers more functionalities out of the box compared to venv, mainly a way to specify dependencies in a looser way, and some commands to build and publish a package. When adding a dependency, poetry allows several options of version constraints , used to specify which version of the requested package can be installed. For example poetry add requests@^1.2.3 would allow the range >=1.2.3 <2.0.0 . Refer to the documentation for a full list of possible constraints. When adding a dependency, it is registered in the pyproject.toml file, which is used when installing the project to resolve all the dependencies needed. Install poetry \u00b6 To install poetry, run curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 - Todo add to path? or is $HOME/.local/bin already on it? Restart the terminal to apply the changes and check that poetry is installed with poetry --version R \u00b6 You are on your own. DBeaver \u00b6 SQL people suggest using this. It's useful as it has auto completion of the column names, and it adds a bunch of useful tools. Install the community edition and set up the connection to the database you'll be working on. KeePass \u00b6 It's already installed, use it. FZF \u00b6 Typing Ctrl + R triggers the reverse-i-search in most Linux terminals, which lets you search through previous commands, by typing the beginning of the command. FZF is a general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder, which lets you filter the history by typing a non-contiguous substring of the command you are looking for. For example, if you are looking for the command dbfs cp dbfs:/FileStore/fold/name/results/* local/results/ you can type something like dbcpforeloc , that is dbfs cp dbfs:/FileStore/fold/name/results/* local/results/ db cp fo re loc and probably get the right one. The list of possible matches is updated after every keystroke, so just filter them more as needed.
