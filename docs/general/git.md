# Git

Git (/ɡɪt/) is free and open source software for distributed version control:
tracking changes in any set of files and collaboratively developing source code.
Every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository
with complete history and full version-tracking abilities.
This makes the initial clone of the repository slower, but subsequent operations such as commit, blame, diff, merge, and log dramatically faster[^1][^2].

There are plenty of Git tutorials available,
this guide will be heavily inspired by a lot of them, such as
[GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world),
[Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/git)
and the
[official docs](https://git-scm.com/doc).

!!! note

    Git and [GitHub](https://github.com/) are different things:
    Git is a version control system,
    GitHub is a hosting service to manage Git repositories.
