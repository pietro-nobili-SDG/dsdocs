# Set up the env

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes a minimal level of confidence while using the command line.
If you never did that, read this
[introduction to the command line](../../general/unix).

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

Follow this guide to install the
[Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
(WSL).

In broad terms, the WSL lets you start a virtual machine with a different operating system running on it, without requiring a dual boot.

## VSCode

Follow this guide to install
[Visual Studio Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode),
(VSCode).

Please note that VSCode is installed on the Windows operating system.
The
[Remote Development Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack)
is what lets you access the tools installed on the WSL (e.g. Python, gcc).

TODO install a bunch of useful extensions

## Python

### Poetry

venv?

## DBeaver

SQL people suggest using this.
It's useful as it has auto completion of the column names,
and it adds a bunch of useful tools.

Install the
[community edition](https://dbeaver.io/download/)
and set up the
[connection to the database](https://dbeaver.com/2022/03/03/how-to-create-database-connection-in-dbeaver/)
you'll be working on.

## KeePass

It's already installed, use it.
